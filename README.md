# Basics of Programming in C++

**Welcome to my humble programming with C++ tutorials.**

In these tutorials, we’ll learn programming together using the book:
[*Programming — Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)*](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)

The code in this repository is a supplement to my [YouTube tutorials](#). <!-- Replace # with actual link -->

Each directory in this repo corresponds to a YouTube video and contains the `.org` file featured in that video, which includes the full tutorial.

You’ll also find a few subdirectories with:
- Solutions to drills and exercises  
- Images used in the `.org` files

> ⚠️ **Warning:** *The solutions are meant only for comparison with your own work.*  
> Please don’t use them as a shortcut to the answers for drills, exercises, etc.  
> If you want to get the maximum benefit from the course, try to solve everything on your own first.  
> Then, use the solutions only to check whether your answers match mine.

If you run into any issues, please don’t hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.  
That’s it — enjoy! 😊

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you already have a working setup consisting of:

1. **A text editor** – such as VS Code, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Vim, etc.  
2. **A C++ compiler** – such as GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.

If you don’t already have these tools installed, you can check this YouTube video to get started:  
🎥 [How to set up a C++ programming environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWD7wfhgNY&t=135s)  
The video uses GCC with Visual Studio Code, but there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube—feel free to choose the setup that works best for you. 🙂
