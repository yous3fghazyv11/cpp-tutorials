## Introduction
**Welcome to my humble programming with C++ tutorials.**

The code in this repository is a supplement to my [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@yousefghazy).

Each directory in this repo corresponds to a YouTube video and contains the `.org` file featured in that video, which includes the full tutorial.

You may also find few sub directories with with header files if any are used in the lecture.  

Images used in the `.org` files will live in the images directory, links from `.org` files will refer to them.

> **Why i didn't post the solutions?**
> Even a little peek at the solution can ruin the whole idea of the exercise for you,
> and as a learner myself, i know that it gets very hard to resist peeking at the solution

> **What if I'm stuck and i really need help?**
> Use the issues section to raise an issue, i will help you ^_^

If you run into any issues, please don’t hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.  
That’s it — enjoy! :)

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you already have a working setup consisting of:

1. **A text editor** – such as VS Code, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Vim, etc.  
2. **A C++ compiler** – such as GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.

If you don’t already have these tools installed, you can check this YouTube video to get started:  
[How to set up a C++ programming environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWD7wfhgNY&t=135s)  
The video uses GCC with Visual Studio Code, but there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube—feel free to choose the setup that works best for you. ^_^
