* Basics of Programming in C++
Welcome to my humble programming with C++ tutorials.

in these tutotrials we try to learn programming together using this book: [[https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html][Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)]].

the code in this repo is a supplementary to my [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUb6sFqVzE0&list=PLAHKaJGVF3tq9nAQNCSbjQFZe8PULjxUI][youtube tutorials]].

each directory in this repo will represent a youtube video, and will have the =.org= file found in the video, which is going to have all the tutorials.

along with few subdirectories for solutions to drills, exercises, images in the org file, etc...

if you are having trouble with anything please don't hasitate to open up a *pull request*.
and that's it, enjoy :)
