* Basics of Programming in C++
*Welcome to my humble programming with C++ tutorials.*

In these tutorials, weâ€™ll learn programming together using the book: [[https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html][Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)]].

The code in this repository is a supplement to my [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUb6sFqVzE0&list=PLAHKaJGVF3tq9nAQNCSbjQFZe8PULjxUI][Youtube tutorials]].

Each directory in this repo corresponds to a YouTube video and contains the =.org= file featured in that video, which includes the full tutorial.

Youâ€™ll also find a few subdirectories with solutions to drills and exercises, as well as images used in the =.org= files.

If you run into any issues, please donâ€™t hesitate to open a pull request.
Thatâ€™s itâ€”enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
